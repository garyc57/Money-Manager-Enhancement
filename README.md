# Money-Manager-Enhancement
Money Manager EX enhancement for storing old transactions into a MM EX usable backup file.

As far as I'm aware, Money Manager EX doesn't have the ability to archive old transactions into a separate MM EX usable backup file.  For example, if I started using MM EX in 2016, and it's now Janury 2020, I'd like to move all 2016 transactions into a 2016 MM EX usable file.

"Usable" is defined as a file that can be opened by MM EX, read, analyzed, etc.

Caveats:  I personally don't use stocks, shares, or assets, so none of those tables will be checked in this code.
